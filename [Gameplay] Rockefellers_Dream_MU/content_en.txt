## Building aid using the example of a cross:

![](../doc/cross.png)


## Preface :

- The buildings connect to each other automatically,except for the warehouses !
- In order to be able to place a glass roof, the buildings have a free area in the middle that can be built over. ( 3x3 building area )
- The glass roofs have different numbers of 1x1 building areas, depending on size and shape.
  These can be built over to support all possible building variations.
- We have tried to cover all possible building variations with the glass roofs.
  Should a possibility arise during the game that cannot be covered with glass roofs, please send me a screenshot of it, thank you.
- Because of the roofing,the construction method with terrain adjustment was chosen.


## Building description :

- In order to be able to place a glass roof, the opposite buildings need a distance of "3" fields to each other.
  This creates a "tunnel" that is 3 fields wide.
  This is the width that is covered by the glass roofs.
- This 3-field rule must also be observed at corners and intersections!
- Crossings are not possible with the functional buildings because of the road connection.
  These can only be created with an additional ornamental building!
- The ends of the "cross" can also be completely designed with the different warehouses.
  These all have a double passageway.
- It is recommended that the "tunnel" be completely finished (roads, ornaments, etc.) before the glass roof is placed as the final element.
  Exceptions are the glass roofs which place a construction area exactly at a passage.
  In these cases, please build the glass roof first, because this construction area can be built over.
