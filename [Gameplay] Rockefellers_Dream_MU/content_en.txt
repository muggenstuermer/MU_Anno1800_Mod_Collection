Building aid using the example of a cross:
------------------------------------

	Preface :
	--------
	- The buildings connect to each other automatically,except for the warehouses !
	
	- In order to be able to place a glass roof, the buildings have a free area in the middle that can be built over. ( 3x3 building area )
	
	- The glass roofs have different numbers of 1x1 building areas, depending on size and shape.
	  These can be built over to support all possible building variations.
	  
	- We have tried to cover all possible building variations with the glass roofs.
	  Should a possibility arise during the game that cannot be covered with glass roofs, please send me a screenshot,
	  please send me a screenshot of it, thank you.
	  
	- Because of the roofing,the construction method with terrain adjustment was chosen.
	
	
	Building description :
	------------------
	
	- In order to be able to place a glass roof, the opposite buildings need a distance of "3" fields to each other.
	  This creates a "tunnel" that is 3 fields wide.
	  This is the width that is covered by the glass roofs.
	  
	- This 3-field rule must also be observed at corners and intersections!
	
	- Building intersections are not possible with the functional buildings, because of the road connection.
	  These can only be created with an additional ornamental building !
	
	- The front sides of the "cross" can also be designed completely with the different warehouses.
	  These all have a double passageway.
	  
	- It is recommended that the "tunnel" be completely finished beforehand (roads, ornaments, etc.) before the glass roof is placed as the finale.
	  Exceptions are the glass roofs which place a construction area exactly at a passage.
	  There please build the glass roof first, because this building field can be built over.

Note :
-----------
Textures of the modder @jje1000 were used for skin variants.originally they should not be integrated into this mod,
but only refer to the two mods.
since at the time of creation these mods were not yet checked for GU16,they were added as a transitional solution for now and will be later,
later, when the mods are up to date again, they will be removed and the necessity of these two mods will be pointed out.

The mods are as follows:
