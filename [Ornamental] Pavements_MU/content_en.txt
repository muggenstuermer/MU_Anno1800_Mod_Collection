# Pavements_MU

![](../doc/pavements_banner.jpg)

This mod includes all floor tiles and all quays from CO2 and HO2.
The floor tiles on land can be built over, so all objects can be redesigned.
But there is one disadvantage: the blockers no longer work reliably.
There may be a second version of this in the future, in which the blockers are designed differently.
