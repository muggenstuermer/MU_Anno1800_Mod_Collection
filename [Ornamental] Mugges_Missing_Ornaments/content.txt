# Mugges_Missing_Ornaments

![](../doc/missing_ornaments_banner.jpg)

This mod includes all missing and desired ornaments from CO2 and HO2
that do not fit thematically into existing MU mods.
Some of the ornaments have been revised and new content has also been added.
For example, functional workers' seaside houses can be built. The bodies of water can be visually connected with connecting pipes,
and it is possible to place bridges over the plots.
