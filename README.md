Based on the industry dlc, this mod offers the possibility to build an upgradeable "storage" city with modified dockland modules.
"Speicher"-city", and thus to create an "industrial district".
It is possible to build depots on the land in the Old World, New World, Arctic and Enbesa, which can be upgraded in 3 steps.
upgrade.

However, the active mod "New World Docklands" by @Lrds xormenter is required for this:
https://www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/mods/215

Optically matching, 2 warehouses with a passage are included, which can also be upgraded in 3 steps.

Everything is unlocked together with the storage city from the Docklands DLC.

In the Old World you can select the desired skin with the brush from the building menu:

- Docklands Original for the Old World
- New World skin from the mod "New World Docklands".
- Enbesa skin from the mod "New World Docklands".

Since you cannot change a skin in the other sessions, only the skins from the mod "New World Docklands" are available in these sessions.

For the Arctic, the texture from the "Winter" mod by @Lirvan was used.
https://www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/mods/311
Since he also gave us the possibility to create them ourselves with his tools,
to create them with his tools, I see no problem and thank him very much for that.
I couldn't manage to create it myself :( .

Furthermore, this mod brings with it an underground depot.
Through the glass dome, you can observe what's happening underground.
In the old world, you can select the desired skin from the building menu with the brush.
You can choose from :

- Adapted to Docklands for the Old World
- Adapted to the mod "New World Docklands" for the New World
- Adapted to the mod "New World Docklands" for Enbesa

I have adapted the colours of the Arctic.


The warehouses are identical to the vanilla building when upgraded:
- LvL 1 has 2 loading ramps
- Lvl 2 has 3 loading ramps
- Lvl 3 has 4 loading ramps
- Lvl 4 has 6 loading ramps

The "Dockland" depots have the following storage capacities:
- LvL 1 has 30t
- LvL 2 has 65t
- LvL 3 has 105t
- LvL 4 has 150t

The underground depots have a storage capacity of 30t per object and are not upgradeable.

These values will be changed in the future with the final release of the Anno 1800 Mod Manager :
https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno/releases/latest
freely changeable.

You can find the building menu :

-In the old world at the craftsmen, after the "middle harbour".
-in the New World at the Oberos, after the "Great Harbour
-In the Arctic, with the Technicians, after the "Harbour
-Enbesa with the Elders,after the "Great Port".

The mod is available for all languages this time ;)

![image](https://github.com/muggenstuermer/Skyline_New_Era_MU/blob/main/382-1654210484-1099724876.png)

Skyscrapers now get the 3 existing skinpacks from Vibrant Citys in their full extent.
For technical reasons, changing the skins of the skyscrapers is only possible as a variation change, shift+V !
They always follow this pattern in the order:

- Original building ( no matter what height and composition )
- Brick" skin
- Nightlife" skin
- "Colourful" skin

this applies to all 7 possible skyscraper types, regardless of their height and composition.


In addition, this mod provides all department stores in skyscraper optics, which initially resemble a construction site.

- department stores'
- furniture store
- Drugstore


All department stores' heights and skins,can be changed via the skin system.

- Lvl `1` with `1` floor with possible skins : Original, Brick, Nightlife, Colourful

- Lvl `3` with `3` floors with possible skins : Original, Brick, Nightlife, Colourful
- Lvl `4` with `4` floors with possible skins : Original, Brick, Nightlife, Colourful
- Lvl `5` with `5` floors with possible skins : Original, Brick, Nightlife, Colourful

Recipes as well as the department stores are unlocked like the original.

The area of effect has been lowered from 45 to 25.

## Building aid using the example of a cross:

![image](https://github.com/muggenstuermer/Rockefellers_Dream_MU/blob/main/cross.png)

## Preface :
------------

- The buildings connect to each other automatically,except for the warehouses !

- In order to be able to place a glass roof, the buildings have a free area in the middle that can be built over. ( 3x3 building area )

- The glass roofs have different numbers of 1x1 building areas, depending on size and shape.
  These can be built over to support all possible building variations.
  
- We have tried to cover all possible building variations with the glass roofs.
  Should a possibility arise during the game that cannot be covered with glass roofs, please send me a screenshot of it, thank you.
  
- Because of the roofing,the construction method with terrain adjustment was chosen.
	
	
## Building description :
-------------------------

- In order to be able to place a glass roof, the opposite buildings need a distance of "3" fields to each other.
  This creates a "tunnel" that is 3 fields wide.
  This is the width that is covered by the glass roofs.
  
- This 3-field rule must also be observed at corners and intersections!

- Building intersections are not possible with the functional buildings, because of the road connection.
  These can only be created with an additional ornamental building !

- The front sides of the "cross" can also be designed completely with the different warehouses.
  These all have a double passageway.
  
- It is recommended that the "tunnel" be completely finished beforehand (roads, ornaments, etc.) before the glass roof is placed as the finale.
  Exceptions are the glass roofs which place a construction area exactly at a passage.
  There please build the glass roof first, because this building field can be built over.

## Note :
---------

Textures of the modder @jje1000 were used for skin variants.originally they should not be integrated into this mod,
but only refer to the two mods.
since at the time of creation these mods were not yet checked for GU16,they were added as a transitional solution for now and will be later,
later, when the mods are up to date again, they will be removed and the necessity of these two mods will be pointed out.

The mods are as follows:
White City - Palace-Museum Expansion : https://www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/mods/433

# Green_Mile_MU

![image](https://github.com/muggenstuermer/Green_Mile_MU/blob/main/screenshot_2023-02-15-18-03-07.jpg)

This mod contains all trees and plants from City and Harbour_Ornaments and have been reworked.

To maintain the vanilla build menu appearance for the ornaments, the Arctic and Enbesa have also received an ornaments tab.

I have added a separate mods tab.

This new menu may be used by other modders, and is basically desired, as long as it fits into this section.
