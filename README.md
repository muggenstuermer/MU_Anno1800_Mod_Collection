## `A_Modified_Ornaments_Tab_MU`

![](./doc/tab_banner.jpg)

To get the vanilla building menu appearance for the ornaments, the Arctic and Enbesa also got an ornaments menu.
I have added a separate mods and harbour tab.

The existing categories don't really offer much space for mods, and the number of mods is constantly increasing.
I was also missing the possibility of sorting port ornaments in a meaningful way, because not every port is industrial.

This new menu can be used by other modders, and is basically desirable, as long as it fits into these categories and wants to be used.

## `Immigrants_And_Their_Fields_MU`

![](./doc/immigrants_banner.jpg)

This mod brings a new population into the game, the "immigrants".

They have no great demands and are mostly self-supporters.
They grow what they need to survive themselves with the ornamental fields they bring with them.

They are warmly welcomed and gladly offer their "peasant" labour.

There is room for up to 36 family members in their small huts. after all, they know each other :) .

They designed and built their public buildings themselves, and they are particularly proud of that.

Who knows, but maybe one or the other immigrant will discover his talent for the economy and open a place of work, who knows?

## Building aid using the example of a cross:

![](./doc/cross.png)


## Preface :

- The buildings connect to each other automatically,except for the warehouses !
- In order to be able to place a glass roof, the buildings have a free area in the middle that can be built over. ( 3x3 building area )
- The glass roofs have different numbers of 1x1 building areas, depending on size and shape.
  These can be built over to support all possible building variations.
- We have tried to cover all possible building variations with the glass roofs.
  Should a possibility arise during the game that cannot be covered with glass roofs, please send me a screenshot of it, thank you.
- Because of the roofing,the construction method with terrain adjustment was chosen.


## Building description :

- In order to be able to place a glass roof, the opposite buildings need a distance of "3" fields to each other.
  This creates a "tunnel" that is 3 fields wide.
  This is the width that is covered by the glass roofs.
- This 3-field rule must also be observed at corners and intersections!
- Crossings are not possible with the functional buildings because of the road connection.
  These can only be created with an additional ornamental building!
- The ends of the "cross" can also be completely designed with the different warehouses.
  These all have a double passageway.
- It is recommended that the "tunnel" be completely finished (roads, ornaments, etc.) before the glass roof is placed as the final element.
  Exceptions are the glass roofs which place a construction area exactly at a passage.
  In these cases, please build the glass roof first, because this construction area can be built over.

## `Worlds_New_Depots_MU`

![](./doc/depots_banner.jpg)

Based on the industry dlc, this mod offers the possibility to build an upgradeable "storage" city with modified dockland modules.
"Speicher"-city", and thus to create an "industrial district".
It is possible to build depots on land and water in the Old World, New World, Arctic and Enbesa.

Optically matching, warehouses with a passage are included.
(original model originally comes from @Jacob,and was modified and used with his permission,thanks for that) 
	
Everything is unlocked together with the storage city from the Docklands DLC.

### The Depots:

Possibility to upgrade them in 3 stages. They grow in height.

With the exception of the arctic, all regions contain a possible skin change :

	- Docklands Original for the Old World
	- New World skin from the mod "New World Docklands".
	- Enbesa skin from the mod "New World Docklands".

For the Arctic, the texture from the "Winter" mod by @Lirvan was used.

https://www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/mods/311

Since he also gave us the possibility to create them ourselves with his tools,
I see no problem and thank him very much for that.
I couldn't manage to create it myself :( .

The Depots have the following storage capacities:
	- LvL 1 has 30t
	- LvL 2 has 65t
	- LvL 3 has 105t
	- LvL 4 has 150t

### The Underground Depots:

This mod also comes with an underground depot.
You can observe what is happening underground through the glass dome.

You can select the desired skin :

	- Adapted to Docklands for the Old World
	- Adapted to the mod "New World Docklands" for the New World
	- Adapted to the mod "New World Docklands" for Enbesa
	- Adapted to the mod "New World Docklands" for Arctic
	
The underground depots have a storage capacity of 30t per object and are not upgradeable.
	
	
### The Warehouses:

Possibility to upgrade them in 3 stages. They grow in height.

The warehouses are identical to the vanilla building when upgraded:

	- LvL 1 has 2 loading ramps
	- Lvl 2 has 3 loading ramps
	- Lvl 3 has 4 loading ramps
	- Lvl 4 has 6 loading ramps
	
### The Warehouse and Depot Special:

This building was the result of a user's wish.
it is possible to build a road x crossing under the building.

Otherwise, the buildings are just like the warehouse or the depots.

This mod contains all trees and plants from City and Harbour_Ornaments and have been reworked.

To maintain the vanilla build menu appearance for the ornaments, the Arctic and Enbesa have also received an ornaments tab.

I have added a separate mods tab.

This new menu may be used by other modders, and is basically desired, as long as it fits into this section.
