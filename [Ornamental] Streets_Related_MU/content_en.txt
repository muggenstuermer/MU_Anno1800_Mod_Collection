Changelog - 1.1
---------------------------
	- Original streets included in the building menu
	- added known streets and street related parts from City_Ornaments_MU_2
	- InternalID collissions to New Horizons fixed, thereby also a restructuring of some objects done
	- created bridges for different possibilities - road bridges - pedestrian bridges - railway bridges
	- reworked known water channels - bridges and optics - rebuilt for added bridges
		- The dirt road got a new bridge for the natural water channel,based on the next cdlc " dragon garden "
		- The cobblestone road has " NO " bridge anymore for all Mod and Vanilla channels.
		- The railway tracks have kept the well known natural water channel railway bridge. 
	- added a modular lake,which can be used under all bridges ,pedestrian bridges excluded ( hinders the use of the bridge by feedback ).
		- Depending on the system and the way of construction, small "holes" can occur because a wrong object was placed.the lake contains all parts to close these gaps correctly.click on the object and use the arrow keys in the UI to find the matching piece !
	- added invisible Harbour_Ornaments_MU_2 content - affects construction of roads from land to water
	- original water channels modified so that original bridge ONLY appears with the dirt road. with the stone road the bridge part is replaced by channel parts to be able to use one of the mod bridges ! Only in Enbesa nothing was changed.
	- Round streets covers in the NW have been colour matched to Jakob's Improved Streets mod.
	- The regions have all got their own roundabouts.
	- tweak options created,which are used as default in the mod,but have to be reset when using iModYourAnno.

	Bridges user manual
	--------------------------
		- Road bridges :
		-------------------
			make sure everything goes over the bridge:
				- always build a bridge first
				- after that build under the bridge : natural water canal or one of the overbuildable canals from this mod or vanilla canal (no sewer,no roads !)
				- last build a road through the bridge / along the bridge
				
		- pedestrian bridges :
		--------------------
				- always build bridge first
				- after that under the bridge you can choose : natural water channel or vanilla channel or a flower bed etc. IMPORTANT ! (no sewers,no roads,no canals to build over - ornamental !)
				- connect the road to the ends of the bridge
				
		- Railway bridges :
		--------------------
			so that the train passes over the bridge:
				- always build the bridge first
				- then build under the bridge either a natural water channel or one of the overbuildable channels from this mod.
				- last build the tracks through the bridge / along the bridge
					- the modular road bridge and the modular railway bridge can be crossed. for this purpose, an extra object is integrated in the modular railway bridge after the crossing (use shift+V or arrow keys in the ui).
				
		- Modular bridges :
		--------------------
			so that everything works:
				- always build bridge first
				- then place the appropriate end piece, road or rails.
				- then under the bridge: one of the overbuildable channels from this mod.
				- then build the roads/rails through the bridge/along the bridge - at a crossing of the modular road bridge and the modular railway bridge,after the regular cross object at the rails,there is a transition object.with shift+V or the arrow keys in the UI,switch forward

	--------------------------------
		- Road bridges :
		-------------------
			unlike bridges on land, you don't have to do anything here other than build the object.
			
		- Footbridges :
		--------------------
			unlike the bridges on land, here you don't have to do anything other than build the object, and pull the quay road or the quay at the ends of the bridge slightly into the bridge.
			
		- Modular bridges :
		--------------------
			in contrast to the bridges on land, all you have to do here is build the object and pull the quay road or the quay at the ends of the bridge slightly into the bridge.
				- the modular pedestrian bridge can be built over. this means that a quay road can be pulled under this bridge (parallel is also possible!). the road is then used by the market carts, while the pedestrians walk on the bridge.
				  This feature is a random product, so it is not impossible that in the future the bridge height might be adjusted.
				  
				- the end section of the modular footbridge,contains a straight section as a variation.the <WaterBlocker> has been removed from this section,so that the small feedback boats can pass underneath.
				  The possibility of using it is self-explanatory.

Changelog - 1.3
---------------------------
	- GU17 modinfo.json correction.
	- The build menu is no longer scrollable due to a bug in GU17, therefore the build menu was splitted.
	  Bug because UBI itself has menus with more than 32 entries !
