# Skyline_New_Era_MU

![](../doc/skyline_banner.jpg)

Skyscrapers now get the 3 existing skinpacks from Vibrant Citys in their full extent.
For technical reasons, changing the skins of the skyscrapers is only possible as a variation change, shift+V !

### The Skyscrapers:

They always follow this pattern in the order:

- first : Original building ( no matter what height and composition ).
- second : "Brick" skin.
- third : "Nightlife" skin.
- last : "Colourful" skin.


### The Malls:

In addition, this mod provides all malls in skyscraper optics, which initially resemble a construction site.

- Department Store
- Furniture Store
- Drug Store


All "house"-malls heights and skins,can be changed via the skin system.

- Lvl 1 with 1 floor with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful
- Lvl 2 with 2 floors with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful
- Lvl 3 with 3 floors with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful
- Lvl 4 with 4 floors with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful
- Lvl 5 with 5 floors with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful

Recipes as well as the department stores are unlocked like the original.

The area of effect has been lowered from 45 to 25.

FullSatisfactionDistance and NoSatisfactionDistance have been halved.

All mall buildings will be available as ornaments for land and water and will bring different neon lights.



### The Warehouse:

You will find also a warehouse in same style with a passage for a street in the middle.

its upgradeable, and it changes its height with each upgrade.

skins from the warehouse could be changed with the skin brush from the buildmenu.



### Recommended active mods :

- ["Spice_Harborlife" by @Taubenangriff](https://mod.io/g/anno-1800/m/harborlife)

The functional buildmenus will follow Harborlife



Ranges could be changed with [IMYA](https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno)
