![](../doc/tourists_banner.jpg)

This mod adds alternative skins for the hotel, bar and café.

It also features new bus stops with and without passages, and a pedestrian overpass with a spiral staircase, also for the water.

It also adds a historic train station, “Historic Station Warehouse”, which takes on the function of a warehouse to improve the cityscape somewhat.also available on the water.

And there are also 2 types of passages....yes,also possible on the water :)

- max. +105 more tourists
- each +15 more through:
	- Tourist harbour
	- Restaurants
	- Variety
	- Café
	- Bar
	- Jam
	- Shampoo
	
- Bars / restaurants / cafés / all shopping arcades / all chemical factories :
	- +15% higher production
	- -25% labour force

### Historic Station Warehouse Building:

- at the sides there is space for 3 rail entrances and exits (or roads, as you like)
- in the middle of each of the main entrances for a street (or whatever you prefer)

### Passages :

- one for double roads
- one for single streets

### Bus Stations:

- there are a large number of bus stops and many variants of them
- some of them have passages for singel and double streets
