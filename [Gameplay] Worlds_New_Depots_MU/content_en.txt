# Worlds_New_Depots_MU

![](../doc/depots_banner.jpg)

Based on the industry dlc, this mod offers the possibility to build an upgradeable "storage" city with modified dockland modules.
"Speicher"-city", and thus to create an "industrial district".
It is possible to build depots on land and water in the Old World, New World, Arctic and Enbesa.

Optically matching, warehouses with a passage are included.
(original model originally comes from @Jacob,and was modified and used with his permission,thanks for that) 
	
Everything is unlocked together with the storage city from the Docklands DLC.

### Depots

Possibility to upgrade them in 3 stages. They grow in height.

With the exception of the arctic, all regions contain a possible skin change :

	- Docklands Original for the Old World
	- New World skin from the mod "New World Docklands".
	- Enbesa skin from the mod "New World Docklands".

For the Arctic, the texture from the "Winter" mod by @Lirvan was used.

Since he also gave us the possibility to create them ourselves with his tools,
I see no problem and thank him very much for that.
I couldn't manage to create it myself :( .

The Depots have the following storage capacities:
- LvL 1 has 30t
- LvL 2 has 65t
- LvL 3 has 105t
- LvL 4 has 150t

### Underground Depots

This mod also comes with an underground depot.
You can observe what is happening underground through the glass dome.

You can select the desired skin :

- Adapted to Docklands for the Old World
- Adapted to the mod "New World Docklands" for the New World
- Adapted to the mod "New World Docklands" for Enbesa
- Adapted to the mod "New World Docklands" for Arctic
	
The underground depots have a storage capacity of 30t per object and are not upgradeable.
	
	
### Warehouses

Possibility to upgrade them in 3 stages. They grow in height.

The warehouses are identical to the vanilla building when upgraded:

- LvL 1 has 2 loading ramps
- Lvl 2 has 3 loading ramps
- Lvl 3 has 4 loading ramps
- Lvl 4 has 6 loading ramps
	
### Warehouse and Depot Special

This building was the result of a user's wish.
it is possible to build a road x crossing under the building.

Otherwise, the buildings are just like the warehouse or the depots.
