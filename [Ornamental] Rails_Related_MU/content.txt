# Rails_Related_MU

![](../doc/rails_banner.jpg)

This mod takes up the topic ‘rails’ and everything that has to do with it, it also allows the construction of rails on the water.
Because this mod explicitly addresses the harbour,some harbour-relevant objects are included.
Even if they do not directly fulfil the mod theme.



## Preface :

- The WaterRails building isnt 100% save.therefor they all have a quay as grounddecal.
- A pefekt Rails connection disables this grounddecal,and a missconnect will shown bei the railing of the quay (grounddecal).
- its also not 100% safe,but a continued connection,should always start in the dirction,the builded rails ends.
- tcrosses and xcrosses always fails.delet this part an buil it new,or drag it once out and drag it back.
- do not use the pickaxe to tear off individual rail parts, but select the part in question and use the remove button on your keyboard.
- i have created a how-to in video format for this mod, and i recommend watching it.
  it explains and illustrates the problems and some explanations on this topic . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_o4fl3M7A
- since the how-to, the build menu has been updated and additional build menus have been added.
	
- Some Words :
  In february 2023 this all should be realised in a coop with @Valiiium.. but suddenly he disapeared and never answered to my mails again.
  In October 2024 @Lion started a mod with same theme.after consulting him,we decided to make coop togheter with our stuff..
  so i changed all my stuff and make new ones... but unfortunately @Lion is also missing at the moment, and is not responding to any of my contacts.
  i hope he is in the best of health and doing well.
  i would like to wait for him out of respect,but i've already built so much on it now, and involved other mods... i have to "pre" release that and hope nobody is upset about it.
