# Rails_Related_MU

This mod takes up the topic ‘rails’ and everything that has to do with it, it also allows the construction of rails on the water.




---------------------------
Note
---------------------------
	- The WaterRails building isnt 100% save.therefor they all have a quay as grounddecal.
	- A pefekt Rails connection disables this grounddecal,and a missconnect will shown bei the railing of the quay (grounddecal).
	- its also not 100% safe,but a continued connection,should always start in the dirction,the builded rails ends.
	- tcrosses and xcrosses always fails.delet this part an buil it new,or drag it once out and drag it back.
	
	- Some Words : In february 2023 this all should be realised in a coop with @Valiiium.. but suddenly he disapeared and never answered to my mails again.
	  In October 2024 @Lion started a mod with same theme.after consulting him,we decided to make coop togheter with our stuff..
	  so i changed all my stuff and make new ones... but sadly,Lion is also gone.
	  i hope he is in the best of health and doing well.
	  i would like to wait for him out of respect,but i have already built so much on it now... i have to "pre" release that and hope nobody is upset about it.
