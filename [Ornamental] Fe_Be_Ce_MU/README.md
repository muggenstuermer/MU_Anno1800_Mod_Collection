# Fe_Be_Ce_MU

![](../doc/febece_banner.jpg)

This mod adds the missing benches, fences and cemetery accessories from CO2 in a modified form.

Furthermore it contains skins for the immigrant chapel, for the old world church (also for Harbor) and for the NW another chapel is integrated into the building menu.

Pretty much everything from the cemetery building menu is overbuildable, except for the sculptures and the fences.
so there are no limits to creativity
