#Green_Mile_MU

This mod contains all trees and plants from City and Harbour_Ornaments and have been revised.

OBSOLETE: HAS BEEN MOVED TO A SEPARATE MOD!
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
To keep the vanilla building menu appearance for the ornaments, the Arctic and Enbesa also got an ornaments tab.
I have added a separate mods tab.
This new menu may be used by other modders, and is basically desired, as long as it fits into this section.

The harbour objects are very difficult or impossible to remove with the remove tool from the construction menu.
This is due to the fact that these objects do not have a ground decal to be able to freely choose the ground, which will be added with future mods.

These objects can be removed by clicking on them and pressing the "Remove" key on the keyboard.

The attractiveness of the objects is set by mod to 2 points per object.
However, this value can be freely changed for each region with the ModManager IModYourAnno (https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno/releases/latest).
